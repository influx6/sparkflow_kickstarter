#SparkFlow Kickstarter

##Prerequisite
  Understanding the basics of FBP is easy but rumtime implementation defer in certain use and defnition of terms,first and foremost,the user must understand that all runtime must be implement similar implementation of components and format language to have proper inter-operability of FBP designs in one runtime to the next. These Tutorials tries best to provide very simple examples as to how the dart runtime for FBP ,Sparkflow works and how to use it to create components and fbp structures,as yet the format language has not be implemented and the native dart UI is in works,as is the framework is ready but much work still needs to be done.This is not to discourage but to encourage you to join in and combine events to truly create something grate.
 
 
##introduction
  The tutorial is pretty basic and very simplified and take you over basics principles and how sparkflow presents components,ports and networks and all interactactions between these different parts Fbp is simple,very basic in thinking and implementation,infact any combinations of data streams and object processing those data is an fbp network but for better structure and combination runtime have been created to provide basic scaffold and easy creation of structures for better management of applications built under the FBP principles.
   
##Sparkflow
  Each tutorial is provides and increasing level of detail as to how sparkflow works from creating simple
  components to using networks and the basics principles are the core of sparkflow as once they are understoo they propagate through out its use, even composed components are just components with internal networks and proxy ports that the component and network share to communicate with other components.

##Use
  The tutorials are tagged with a Ks{number},so as to indicate how to progress but feel free to start from any point as desired,allthough i would still advice taking the first tutorial before tutorial hopping begins


##Remarks
  Please send create issues with github issues,to raise suggestion for more tutorial ideas or suggestions for improvement. Thank you. God bless. (Doumo arigatou gozaimasu, Komapseomnida).
